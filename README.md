PRESENTATION 
------------------------------------------------------------
**Version française [ici](https://github.com/SebastienFRA/LVASI/blob/main/LISEZ-MOI.MD)**

L.V.A.S.I. was born from a desire to have a tool that allows me to download,
install automatically and without intervention on my part, the software
I need in their latest versions. This is to facilitate the acquisition
or reinstallation of a computer.

Knowing nothing about code before embarking on this project, I
scoured the internet a lot to find the answers I was looking for.
I used Jason Bergner's "SilentInstallHQ.com" site a lot.

As of 07/22/2022, [130 softwares are supported](https://github.com/SebastienFRA/LVASI/blob/main/Liste.md). **Get help [here](https://github.com/SebastienFRA/LVASI/blob/main/LVASI%20-%202.1%2B%20-%20HELP.md)**

NOTES 
-------------------------

- Installations are planned on a 64-bit system (32-bit being phased out).

- The installations are primarily made in French. Some software adapts to the language
of the system, but if the software must be downloaded in a specific language, it is
French that I have chosen.

- I wrote the scripts so that they automatically download the latest software version
available.

- The project is of course in "open-source", you are free to modify it, complete it,
improve it, etc.

- Feel free to contact me if there are any problems downloading or installing. I will try to solve the problem
as quickly as possible.

- In "online mode", for OpenOffice and Geforce Experience, 7-zip is required. If you don't have it, LVASI installs it during the process and then uninstalls it.

- LVASI works thanks to a PowerShell script that I make executable thanks to WIN-PS2EXE available on Github [here](https://github.com/MScholtes/Win-PS2EXE).
