PRESENTATION 
------------------------------------------------------------

L.V.A.S.I. was born from a desire to have a tool that allows me to download,
install automatically and without intervention on my part, the software
I need in their latest versions. This is to facilitate the acquisition
or reinstallation of a computer.

Knowing nothing about code before embarking on this project, I
scoured the internet a lot to find the answers I was looking for.
I used Jason Bergner's "SilentInstallHQ.com" site a lot.

As of 07/19/2022, 113 softwares are supported. **Get help [here](https://github.com/SebastienFRA/LVASI/blob/main/LVASI%20-%202.1%2B%20-%20HELP.md)**

NOTES 
-------------------------

- Installations are planned on a 64-bit system (32-bit being phased out).

- The installations are primarily made in French. Some software adapts to the language
of the system, but if the software must be downloaded in a specific language, it is
French that I have chosen.

- I wrote the scripts so that they automatically download the latest software version
available.

- The project is of course in "open-source", you are free to modify it, complete it,
improve it, etc.

- Feel free to contact me if there are any issues with one or more scripts. Also feel
free if you want me to add supported software, I'll try to do my best.
