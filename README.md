PRESENTATION 
------------------------------------------------------------

L.V.A.S.I. is a small personal project that responds to a desire:
To have a tool that allows me to download, install automatically and
without intervention on my part, the software I need in their latest
versions. This is to facilitate the acquisition or reinstallation of
a computer.

L.V.A.S.I. works thanks to scripts written under PowerShell 5, and it
is intended for Windows.

Knowing nothing about it before embarking on this project, I
scoured the internet a lot to find the answers I was looking for.
I used Jason Bergner's "SilentInstallHQ.com" site a lot.

As of 07/14/2022, 111 softwares are supported

NOTES 
-------------------------

- Installations are planned on a 64-bit system (32-bit being phased out).

- The installations are primarily made in French. Some software adapts to the language
of the system, but if the software must be downloaded in a specific language, it is
French that I have chosen.

- I wrote the scripts so that they automatically download the latest software version
available.

- The project is of course in "open-source", you are free to modify it, complete it,
improve it, etc.

- Feel free to contact me if there are any issues with one or more scripts. Also feel
free if you want me to add supported software, I'll try to do my best.
