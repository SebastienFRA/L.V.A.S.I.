## ONLINE MODE ("MODE EN LIGNE") :
Online mode allows 2 options :

- The "**Installer**" button (**1**): Download and install the selected software directly
- The "**Télécharger**" button (**2**): Only download selected software for future installation
_(convenient when it comes to installing on a computer that does not have an internet connection,
or when it is necessary to install on several machines without having to re-download each time)_

-> **Installer** :  
LVASI creates a folder "**LVASI - Installation**" in which it downloads selected software.
Downloaded files are automatically deleted at the end of each installation.
A notification is displayed at the end of each installation.
When all the installations are finished, the "**LVASI - Installation**" folder is deleted.
A window is then displayed to inform you that LVASI has finished.

-> **Télécharger** :  
LVASI creates a folder "**LVASI - Téléchargements**" in which it downloads the selected software.
A notification is displayed at the end of each download.
A window is then displayed to inform you that LVASI has finished.

## OFFLINE MODE ("MODE HORS LIGNE") :
  
The "**Installer**" button (**4**) allows you to install software downloaded earlier.
To activate the "**Installer**" button, you must refresh using the small button located just above (**3**). (If LVASI does not find the "**LVASI - Téléchargements**"folder or if no software is present there, the button will remain disabled.
Only software downloaded by LVASI is supported (file names and formats as well as installation parameters are specific to each software).
It is therefore important not to rename or move the downloaded files.
For the software to be recognized by LVASI, the "**LVASI - Téléchargements**" folder must be in the same directory as LVASI.exe:
  
Par ex. :  
..\Download\\  
-- LVASI_v2.1.exe  
-- LVASI - Downloads\
  
**IMPORTANT:** All the software present in the "**LVASI - Téléchargements**" folder will be installed.
Move or delete software you don't want to install.
